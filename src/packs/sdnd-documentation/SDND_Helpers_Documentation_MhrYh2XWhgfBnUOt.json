Since light and sound control are on separate control layers, I found myself wanting a fast way to light or extinguish fires.</p><p>I was using Monk's Active Tiles to handle this, but it is a <em><strong>lot</strong></em> of clicks to setup a single instance.</p><p>The result is that I automated the ability to link an active tile to an overlapped light and sound. When you double-click the active tile, the fire will either light or extinguish and a message will be written to the chat log.</p><img src=\"modules/stroud-dnd-helpers/images/demos/fireplace_demo.gif\" alt=\"fireplace demo\" /><h2>Steps to create:</h2><ol><li><p>Place a light source with desired settings.</p></li><li><p>Place a sound in the same location.</p></li><li><p>Place a ground tile that covers your light and sound effect and just save it with default settings.</p></li><li><p>While that ground tile is selected in the UI, click the Create Fireplace macro.</p></li></ol><p>You will end up with an active tile that is visible only to the GM and is activated with a double-click.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p>If you duplicate a scene with fireplaces or export/import to a different world, the fireplaces may not function.
