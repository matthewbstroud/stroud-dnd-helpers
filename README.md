# Readme
My collection of automation for foundy v11 and DND 5e (v3.1.2)

If you appreciate the module support me [HERE](https://ko-fi.com/sdnddonations)

Configuring midi-QOL tends to be a challenge for new players.  I have included my settings [HERE](/misc/StroudDnDMidiQOLSettings_v11.json "download").  
Feel free to download them and install them as a starting point.

You can install these settings as follows: 
- Configure Settings
- midi-QOL Settings
- Click Workflow Settings
- Select Misc tab
- Click the Import midi-qol settings from JSON file. 

There are also some convenient effects that I use in the adventures
Grab them [HERE](/misc/fred_custom_effects.json "download").
